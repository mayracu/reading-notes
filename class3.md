## Practicing with Git

Today I synced my github Reading Notes repo to my local computer. Now I can make changes from a text editor in my computer and use a terminal to ACP my changes.

ACP stands for Add, Commit and Push. This means that every time I make a change in my text editor, I'll need to save the changes, go to my terminal, add the changes to my repo directory, commit the changes and push them.

Another important thing I learned today was that after syncing your repo to your computer, you shouldn't make any more changes using GitHub. Any change you make to your repo it has to be made using your local computer.
