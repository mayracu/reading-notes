# Structure web pages with HTML

- Before creating the structure of an html web page is important to make a wireframe.
- A wireframe is a sort of prototype or visual representation of a website.  
- Wireframes can be made by hand, or using online tools like Google Drawings.

## HTML

- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of content in a website.
- The main parts of an HTML element are: opening tag, closing tag, content, and sometimes they have attributes.

       <p> The balloon is red </p>

- In HTML there are elements that are semantic which means that they have a defined purpose.
- Some semantic elements in HTML are the following:

        <article>
        <aside>
        <details>
        <figcaption>
        <figure>
        <footer>
        <header>
        <main>
        <mark>
        <nav>
        <section>
        <summary>
        <time>
