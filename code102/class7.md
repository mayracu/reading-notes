# Programming with JavaScript

## Control flow

Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. The program structure affects order of execution.

## A JavaScript Function

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. The code block is the info in between brackets. p1 and p2 are the parameters of the function:

    // Function to compute p1 + p2
    function myFunction(p1, p2) {
     return p1 + p2;
    }

- Functions help developers to reuse code.
-Important: variables declared inside a function can only be invoked within the function.

## JavaScript Operators

- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators: loosely equal (==), strictly equal (===), not equal (!=), <, >, etc.
- Logical Operators: &&, \|\|, !
- Conditional Operators: if, else if
- Type Operators: typeof
