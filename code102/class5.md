# Designing Web Pages with CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is useful for text styling, layout creation and animation of web sites.

## 3 ways to write CSS

- **External:** Utilizing a separate CSS file connected to HTML
- **Internal:** CSS is built into the HTML file (inside the head section)
- **Inline:** CSS is built into the HTML element. Any inline CSS rule takes precedent over internal or external CSS rules.

## Class and ID Selectors

- You can identify an HTML element with an ID and select the specified element to stylize it with CSS

`<img id ="hero" src="" alt="" />`

- You can add a "class" to a subset of html elements so they can have the same look when the class is targeted on CSS.

## CSS Color property

To set text color for diferent elements. Example of syntax:

    body {
      color: blue;
    }

The values for the color property can be given on RGB, HEX, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA.
