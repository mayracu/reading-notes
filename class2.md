## What is a tex editor?

A text editor is one of the most important tools for a software developer. It's a tool very useful to write code and build a website.  

### Why is a text editor important?

Text editors don't have hidden formatting and can include features that help developers code more efficiently.

### Features to look for in a text editor

- *Code completion*: this feature allows developers to start typing and get possible suggestions for their code, such as the closing of tags or brackets when these are opened. 
- *Syntax Highlighting*: this feature takes the text you type and makes it more noticeable by using different colors, such as different colors for attributes and elements. This makes easier to find errors in your code.
- *Variety of themes*: this feature allows developers to change the background of their text editor, the color of text, etc.
- *Extensions*: this feature allows developers to add functionality to their code.

## The Command Line

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. It will typucally present you with a prompt after which you will be issuing commands.

`pc@user: l -1 /home/paul`

- Typically a command is always the first thing you type after the prompt.
- Command line arguments are separated by spaces ( -l /home/paul). 
- The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options modify the behaviour of the command. They are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - ).
