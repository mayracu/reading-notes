## Video and Audio Content

### Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s

- Online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight, which had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete.
- Nowadays, online videos and audio can be handle through HTML and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them.

### Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the `<video>` element

- src (source): This attribute contains a path to the video to embed.

- controls: This attribute is used to include the browser's own control interface, or build an interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.

### Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?

The paragraph inside the `<video>` tags is called fallback content. This content will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the `<video>` element, allowing the developers to provide a fallback for older browsers.

### Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters

audio and video are two friends who really like to spend time together to watch movies and listen to music. They think they are really cool!

## A Complete Guide To Grid

### How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

- Flexbox is one dimensional whereas grid is two dimensional.
- Grid is mostly defined on the parent element. In flexbox, most of the layout happen on the children.
- Grid is better at overlapping.

### Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences

- When the display property of an element is set to grid, it defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

- A grid container contains grid items. By default, a container has one grid item for each column, in each row, but the grid items can be styled so that they will span multiple columns and/or rows.

- The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.

- The horizontal lines of grid items are called rows.

## Responsive Images

### Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

- There is no need to embed large images (intent to be viewed on a desktop) on the page if it is being viewed on a mobile screen. Doing so can waste bandwidth.
- Some devices have high resolution screens that need larger images to display nicely.

### Define the following `<img>` attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used

- `srcset` defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is.
- `sizes` defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true

### How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

When the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download any images before the main parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. This mechanism is useful for reducing page load times, but it's not helpful for responsive images.
