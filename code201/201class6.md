# Class 6: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

### How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

An object stores key-value pairs in an organized way. These key-values are organized like a collection of objects or records.

### What are some advantages to creating object literals?

It saves us time to create object literals when we want to create structured data.

### How do objects differ from arrays?

An object stores key-values whereas an array stores individual items.

### Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation

We would need to use bracket notation when we want to link a property's name to a variable value.

### Evaluate the code below. What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?

```
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  olor: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
```

The term this refers to the values of the properties called name and age. The this keyword enables us to use the same method definition for every object we create.

## Introduction To The DOM

### What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.

### Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript

JavaScript uses the DOM to access the document and its elements.
