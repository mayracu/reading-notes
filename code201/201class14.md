### Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety

When I was in college, very often I had to work with other classmates to create a presentation or make a collaborative report.

Some of this team projects were short, others longer, but I remember that I preferred to work with certain classmates because I liked the way they communicated their ideas and listened to each others opinions.

The team dynamics is very important to get the job done, and in that regards, an ambience of psychological safety can make people feel motivated, more relaxed and energized.

### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs. This kind of teams create a safe space for its members to take risks that lead to success.
