# Class 8: CSS Layout

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means

It means that flexbox is designed for arranging items in rows or columns.

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis

The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Using flexbox to reorder the visual display of a feature can negatively impact accessibility. This is because the reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. The logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the HTML content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

- Using flexbox we can vertically center a block of content inside its parent.
- Flexbox allow us to make all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
- Using flexbox we can make all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

### How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

- Flexbox allows me to layout my content in a better way, so definitely it's a nice tool to know in order to build a website.
