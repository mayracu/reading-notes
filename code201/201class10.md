# Class 10: Debugging

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

Syntax errors are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, whereas logic errors are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

- I usually encounter this kind of error where a variable has been defined but not used.
- Forgetting to close a bracket.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I think founding bugs in my code is something that is part of the job of a software developer. Debugging code in efficient ways will have a positive impact in my studies and work.

## The JavaScript Debugger

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript debugger is a useful tool that allows developers to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints (places in your code) that you want to pause execution and identify the problems (bugs) that prevent your code from executing properly.

### Define what a breakpoint is

A breakpoint is a place in your code where you want to pause exacution to identify a bug.

### What is the call stack?

The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.

## Things I want to learn more about

I'd like to gain more practice using the Javascript debugger tool.
