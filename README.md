# My Reading Journal

Hi, my name is Mayra! Welcome to my page. 

On this site I will post some notes and thoughts about my classes and learning path to become a software developer. To access my github portfolio you can click [here.](https://github.com/mayracu)

## Keeping a Growth Mindset

In my first class, we discussed what it means to have a growth mindset, which involves removing from our minds the idea that our talents and abilities are fixed and determined; and instead agreeing with the affirmation that our potential and abilities can always grow and develop to reach their full potential, as long as we work hard and persevere. 

I though about my current goal of becoming a software developer. I know I will face challenges and obstacles, and sometimes I even can feel tempted to throw in the towel, but I have to remember to keep a growth mindset always, especially in moments of frustration. 

Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset: 

1. When hitting an obstacle like when you get stuck trying to solve a problem in your code, remember to breathe and step away for a short period of time. That brief moment will help you relax and it will help reduce frustration. When you come back to look at your code, chances are you will look things in a different way. 
2. Every day remember your goal and do something that moves you forward to that direction.
3. No reward comes without effort. Keep up the good work and enthusiasm! 

I was looking for some quotes to help me get inspiration in moments of frustration. I like this one: 

“Of course everyone has those moments of frustration now and then, when you say, ‘I wish I could play well already―or just stop.’ But it’s too much trouble to stop just for a moment of frustration. It is when you keep going that you make the most progress.” – Hilary Hahn
