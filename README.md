# My Reading Journal

Hi, my name is Mayra! Welcome to my page. 

On this site I will post some notes and thoughts about my classes and learning path to become a software developer. To access my github portfolio you can click [here.](https://github.com/mayracu)

## Keep a Growth Mindset

In my first class, we discussed what it means to have a growth mindset, which involves removing from our minds the idea that our talents and abilities are fixed and determined; and instead agreeing with the affirmation that our potential and abilities can always grow and develop to reach their full potential, as long as we work hard and persevere. 

I though about my current goal of becoming a software developer. I know I will face challenges and obstacles, and sometimes I even can feel tempted to throw in the towel, but I have to ***remember to keep a growth mindset*** always, especially in moments of frustration. 

### Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset

1. Every day remember your goal and do something that moves you forward to that direction 🧗‍♀️
2. No reward comes without effort. Keep up the good work and enthusiasm! 
3. When hitting an obstacle like when you get stuck trying to solve a problem in your code, remember to breathe and step away for a short period of time. That brief moment will help you relax and may help reduce frustration. 

Maybe you can make a cup of coffee for yourself! there's no limites to the powers of this powerful java to lift a troublesome spirit!

When you come back to look at your code, chances are you will look things in a different way 🙂

I was looking for some quotes to help me get motivated in moments of frustration and I found this one which I really like: 

> “Of course everyone has those moments of frustration now and then, when you say, ‘I wish I could play well already―or just stop.’ But it’s too much trouble to stop just for a moment of frustration. It is when you keep going that you make the most progress.”
– Hilary Hahn
