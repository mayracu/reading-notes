# My Reading Journal

Hi, my name is Mayra! Welcome to my page. 

On this site I will post some notes and thoughts about my classes and learning path to become a software developer. To access my github portfolio you can click [here.](https://github.com/mayracu)

## Keep a Growth Mindset

In my first class, we discussed what it means to have a growth mindset, which involves removing from our minds the idea that our talents and abilities are fixed and determined; and instead agreeing with the affirmation that our skills and abilities can always grow and develop to reach their full potential, as long as we work hard and persevere. 

I've been thinking about my current goal of becoming a software developer. I know I will face challenges and obstacles, and even if I sometimes I feel tempted to throw in the towel, I have to ***remember to keep a growth mindset***, especially in moments of frustration. 

### Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset

1. Every day remember your goal and do something that moves you forward in that direction 🧗‍♀️
2. No reward comes without effort. Keep up the good work and enthusiasm! 
3. When hitting an obstacle like when you get stuck trying to solve a problem in your code, remember to breathe and step away for a short period of time. That brief moment will help you relax and may help reduce frustration. 

Perhaps you can make a cup of coffee for yourself! There's no limit to the power of this java to lift a troubled spirit!

When you look back at your code, chances are you will see things in a different way 🙂

I was looking for some quotes to help me get motivated in moments of frustration and I found this one which I really like: 

> “You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.”
– Maya Angelou
